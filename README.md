- **J** – toggle SSAO (Screen Space Ambient Occlusion)
- **K** – spawn holy lambs
- **L** – toggle Blinn lighting on/off
- **Group A** – skybox
- **Group B** – SSAO

## Technologies Used
- **C++ / C**
- **OpenGL** (graphics rendering)
- **CMake** (project configuration and build)
- **GLM** (mathematics for graphics)
- **ImGui** (UI overlay configuration)
- Custom shaders and lighting calculations
